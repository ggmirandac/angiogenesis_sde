# Angiogenesis Modeling

Angiogensis is the process in which the new blood vessels are form from a parent blood vessel. This process is seen in many physiological processes, for example, organ wroth and development. Also, when a wound is form, this process is important for the process of wound healing. Finally, we can see this process in tumors, where new blood vessels are form to generate the process of metastasis. 

From the basis stablished before, we can see that this process is very important for the study of different physiological processes. For this reason, the understandment of this process is key. Here we show an stochastic differential equation model for angiogensis. This model is coded in MatLab for its facility to operate in matricial operations.
